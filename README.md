# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use Python and its Pandas library to analyze math and reading scores within a school district. This published part of the project focused on replacing suspected dishonest scores for a subset of students at one school with null values, and the impact thereof.  There were 461 suspicious scores out of a total of over 39,000 records. All were 9th graders at Thomas High School. Results will be referring to before the replacement of suspicious scores with null values and after, unless otherwise noted.
